<h3>Task Description:</h3>


<h4>Task 1: <strong>Binary Tree Adventure: The Mysterious Insertion and Navigation Challenge</strong></h4>
<p>Once upon a coding adventure, imagine entering a magical world called the Binary Forest&mdash;a place where nodes are like living creatures, and how you move through them reveals hidden secrets. In this enchanted land, nodes connect like magic, creating challenges and mysteries for daring developers like you to solve. Get ready for a journey into a world where every code tells a tale!</p>
<p>In the Binary Forest, a binary tree stood tall&mdash;a majestic structure woven with nodes that held the essence of data. What is a binary tree, you ask? In the Binary Forest, a binary tree is a hierarchical data structure comprising nodes, where each node has at most two children&mdash;a left child and a right child. The topmost node, known as the root, serves as the beginning of the tree, while the branches lead to subtrees below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As you delve into the Binary Forest, your first quest awaits: mastering the art of insertion and navigation with an unexpected twist.</p>

<p><strong>Input &amp; Output for the Task:</strong></p>
<p>Binary Tree Project<br>Enter the root value:&nbsp;<br>33<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>44<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>55<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>63<br>Binary Tree InOrder Traversal after Insertion:<br>[63, 44, 33, 55]</p>



<h4>Task 2: Binary Tree Expedition: The Quest for Pre-order Discovery</h4>
<p>In the vast Binary Forest, where nodes dance with data, a new challenge unfolds&mdash;mastering the art of traversing in the pre-order sequence. As our intrepid developer, you embark on a quest through the BinaryVista class to unravel the mysteries hidden within the binary tree's branches.</p>
<p>Pre-order traversal is a systematic way of exploring or visiting each node in a binary tree. In this traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by a recursive traversal of the left subtree and then the right subtree. The process continues until all nodes in the binary tree have been visited, resulting in a sequence of node values that reflects the pre-order arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>Input &amp; Output for the Task:</strong></p>
<p>Binary Tree Project<br>Enter the root value:&nbsp;<br>33<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>44<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>55<br>Enter a node data to insert in Binary Tree:<br>63<br>Binary Tree InOrder Traversal after Insertion:<br>[63, 44, 33, 55]</p>
<p>Iterative Pre-order Traversal of the Binary Tree:<br>[33, 44, 63, 55]</p>

<h4>Task 3: Binary Tree Symphony: Unveiling the Enchanting Post-Order Waltz</h4>
<p>Embark on the next captivating chapter of your coding adventure in the Binary Forest. In this quest, the focus is on unraveling the enchanting Post-Order Waltz&mdash;a graceful traversal through the Binary Tree where each node performs a dance in sequence. Join the symphony, where the root takes a bow after its children, creating a magical melody that echoes through the branches.</p>
<p>Post-order traversal is a methodical way of exploring or visiting each node in a binary tree. In this traversal, the left and right subtrees are recursively traversed before visiting the root node. The sequence unfolds in a manner where the left subtree is fully explored, followed by the right subtree, and finally, the root node is visited. The result is a sequence of node values reflecting the post-order arrangement&mdash;a unique dance where each node takes its bow after its children have performed.</p>

<p>Iterative Post-order Traversal of the Binary Tree:<br>[63, 44, 55, 33]</p>

<h4>Task 4: <strong>The Mystical Deletion Quest</strong></h4>
<p>Prepare yourself for the next challenge in the Binary Tree Adventure&mdash;the quest to master the ancient art of deletion within the Binary Forest. In this magical realm, where nodes hold the essence of data and traversal unveils secrets, you will embark on a journey to delete nodes and maintain the delicate balance of the enchanted tree.</p>
